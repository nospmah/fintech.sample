## What is the background of your company? What do they do? Who are their competitors?

* Kiva is a non-profit organization that extends “microloans” as small as a few hundred dollars to impoverished borrowers, with the expectation that they will start a business and be able to repay the loan. 
* Competitors include: Grameen America, LiftFund, and Opportunity Fund. 

---

## How does this company use technology to their advantage? Why are they considered a FinTech company?
* Kiva uses a web portal and cell phone app to streamline the microloan process and reach users at scale.
* They are considered a FinTech company because of their innovative crowdsourcing technology platform and use of tech like big data, machine learning and also potential use of facial recognition and blockchain in the future.

## Why is this company exemplary in the FinTech space? What are their strengths and weaknesses?

* Kiva is in the process of setting up payments directly to borrowers via PayPal (direct loans) rather than through local organizations (partner loans). Direct loans cost less to administer, so direct loan borrowers pay no interest or fees - whereas partner loan borrowers pay these. This is a major strength for Kiva. 
* A weakness is that Kiva is one of many micro lenders utilizing this technology, so the market place is competitive. 
* Another weakness is that they are reporting a programmer shortage.

## What is the prognosis for this company? Where do they expect to be in the future?

* Kiva is part of the microlending sector that is experiencing rapid growth.  Lending Club, a player in the same space, had one of the largest tech IPOs in 2014.
